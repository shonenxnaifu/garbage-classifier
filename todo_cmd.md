# Requirements Definition
Add one more API route that allows image upload only, so users don't need to provide categories and just need to upload an image.
The categories will be defined in the code.

# Todo's 
Modify my API based on my todos here:

- Copy the "classify" function and modify the code
- The variable DEFAULT_CLASSES will use candidate_labels from the "Candidate Labels" column from the file WASTE_DEFINITION.md, combining all of the candidate labels together in one variable (DEFAULT_CLASSES)
- Ensure that there are no duplicate candidate labels
- Use DEFAULT_CLASSES as the default candidate labels in the new route API
