# Breaking Down Category of Waste
I will break down the primary categories of waste into 3 main types. 
These Categories are based on the following article: [Understanding the Different Types of Waste](https://www.reelpaper.com/blogs/reel-talk/types-of-waste?srsltid=AfmBOooOT_nUQgx4GtybuQCz3vI5pJp3UbmFR9AmJsNROYAF5WvszdAV)

## 1. Organic Waste
Organic waste is a broad term that encompasses all plant- and animal-based materials that can decompose naturally. This includes food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, cardboard, and even some types of plastic. When organic waste is composted, it breaks down into nutrient-rich soil that can be used to grow new plants. This process helps to reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills, and it also helps to improve soil quality.

Organic waste is a valuable resource that can be used to help sustain life on Earth. By composting organic waste, we can help to reduce pollution, improve soil quality, and create a more sustainable future.

## 2. Hazardouz Waste
Hazardous waste, on the other hand, paints a graver picture. When we talk about hazardous waste, we are referring to a category of waste that, if improperly managed or disposed of, can pose significant threats to human health and the environment. This is not your everyday household trash; rather, it's waste that contains dangerous properties, which can be harmful even in small amounts.

Common types of hazardous waste include:

- Chemicals: Chemicals, a major component of hazardous waste, range from industrial by-products to household agents, and can contaminate water and food supplies, causing various health problems including cancers and reproductive issues.
- Batteries: Batteries, containing heavy metals like lead and mercury, can leach into the environment, accumulate in living organisms, and cause severe health risks including nervous system and kidney damage.
- Medical Waste: Improperly handled medical waste, including used needles and infectious materials, poses a risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly to healthcare workers, waste handlers, and the broader community.

## 3. Solid Waste
Solid waste is a broad category encompassing a range of everyday items we discard, such as packaging materials, food scraps, clothing, and household goods. While seemingly harmless, the accumulation of solid waste in landfills can have insidious effects on the environment. The decomposition of organic waste produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to climate change. Moreover, the presence of non-biodegradable items, such as plastics, in solid waste, can lead to long-term environmental degradation, impacting both landscapes and wildlife.

## 4. Liquid Waste
Often overlooked, liquid waste is another diverse category, encompassing wastewater originating from domestic households, industrial processes, and medical facilities. This type of waste includes everything from wash water and used oils to industrial discharges and chemical waste. If not treated adequately, liquid waste can lead to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, harming aquatic ecosystems and jeopardizing human health through the contamination of drinking water sources. The treatment and proper disposal of liquid waste are, therefore, critical in safeguarding both environmental and public health.

## 5. Recyclable Waste
Recyclable waste includes materials like plastics, paper, glass, and metals, which can be reprocessed and transformed into new products. Recycling plays a crucial role in conserving natural resources, reducing the need for raw materials, and minimizing environmental impacts associated with resource extraction and waste disposal. By redirecting recyclable materials away from landfills, we can significantly reduce the strain on our environment and foster a more sustainable and circular economy. The active participation of both individuals and industries in recycling programs is vital in maximizing the benefits of this process and ensuring a more sustainable future.

# Determines candidate labels
After breaking down the categories of waste, i will determine possible candidate labels based on the categories defined earlier, using the following table.

| **Category**     | **Candidate Labels**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Description**                                                                                                              |
