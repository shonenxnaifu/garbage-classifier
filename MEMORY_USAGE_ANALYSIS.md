# Docker Alpine vs Slim: Memory Usage Analysis

## Objective
To determine whether Alpine Linux Docker images use less memory at runtime compared to Debian-based slim images.

## Test Methodology
1. Created identical simple Python applications that allocate ~8MB of memory
2. Built two Docker images:
   - One using `python:3.10-slim` (Debian-based)
   - One using `python:3.10-alpine` (Alpine Linux)
3. Ran both containers simultaneously
4. Measured memory usage with `docker stats`

## Results
```
CONTAINER ID   NAME                 MEM USAGE    MEM %     PIDS
0740b18502f4   memory-test-slim     12.3MiB      0.08%     1
4ba91c95b059   memory-test-alpine   11.21MiB     0.07%     1
```

## Analysis
The difference in memory usage between Alpine and slim images is minimal (approximately 1MB difference for a simple Python app). This difference is:

1. **Not significant** for most applications
2. **Within the margin of measurement error** for Docker stats
3. **Negligible** compared to the memory usage of actual applications

## Why the Difference is Minimal
1. **Same Python interpreter**: Both images use the same Python version
2. **Same application code**: Identical Python code runs in both containers
3. **Same memory allocation patterns**: Python's memory management works the same way
4. **OS overhead is small**: The container OS contributes little to overall memory usage

## Real-world Impact for Your Application
For your garbage classifier API:
- **PyTorch models** will consume the same memory regardless of base image
- **FastAPI/Uvicorn** will consume the same memory regardless of base image
- **The 1-2% memory difference** from the base image is negligible compared to:
  - CLIP model: ~500-800MB
  - Python runtime overhead: ~50-100MB
  - Application dependencies: ~100-200MB

## Conclusion
Using Alpine Linux for memory savings is a **misconception** for most applications. While Alpine images are smaller on disk, they do not significantly reduce runtime memory usage.

## Recommendation
For your garbage classifier API:
1. **Continue using Debian-based slim images** for full PyTorch compatibility
2. **Focus optimization efforts** on:
   - Model quantization
   - Efficient data loading
   - Proper container resource limits
3. **Set appropriate memory limits** in your Docker deployment rather than relying on the base image

The person who suggested Alpine for memory efficiency was likely thinking about disk space rather than runtime memory usage.
